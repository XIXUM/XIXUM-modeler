# XIXUM-modeler
XIXUM Modeler is an Modeling IDE and AI Model Generator that can edit and generate Models from natural language using Large Language Models (LLMs)
it is a Testing environment where our cognitive Model is built on. 

## Brief description
We use the Modeler a s testing environment for our Cogjnitive AI, which builds formal logic based on a formal model. It all starts with Knowledge graphs as intermediate interface between the Cognitive Model and the natural language interface. 
The modeler uses all kinds of data artifacts and creates data annotation from:
- natural language input (ongoing development)
- sourcecode and data infrastructure (upcoming feature)
- simulation and raw data input for digital twins (planned feature)

it contracts all these input creating an semantic structure where a cognitive model is built on.
This cognitive Model builds the Core for The AI for performing all kinds of logical tasks.
